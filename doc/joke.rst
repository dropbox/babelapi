Why do we have multiple programming languages?
==============================================

From the King James version of the Bible:

    4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

    5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

    6 And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

    7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

    8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

    9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

    —Genesis 11:4–9[1]
